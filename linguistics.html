    <p>Ed Tovell has a BA in Linguistics from University College London, as well as an MPhil from the University of Cambridge. He still loves Linguistics, but he is not <em>in</em> love with it.</p>
    <p>Linguistics is the scientific study of language in all aspects. It has many sub-disciplines that concern themselves with things like word order (syntax), speech sounds (phonetics and phonology) and meaning (semantics and pragmatics). Ed Tovell majored in syntax and minored in phonology for both of his degrees.</p> 
    <p>The study of language does not require that you speak multiple languages, but lots of people think it does. Ed Tovell often gets asked how many languages he speaks by strangers at parties, but he only really speaks English. He knows some bad jokes and could probably order food in French and German. If he could learn any language it would probably be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyirbal_language">Dyirbal</a> because it is endangered and it has a dedicated noun class for vegetables.</p>
    <p>If you like, you can read Ed Tovell's Master's thesis <a href="Ed%20Tovell%20-%20mphil%20thesis.pdf">here</a>. It is called "Towards a Syntactic Account of Literality in Preposition Stranding" and it is very long.</p>
