    <p>Music is very important to Ed Tovell's life and he is constantly singing and writing music and going to watch and listen to music being played by other people.
    </p>
    <p>Ed Tovell and his girlfriend are in a band called Platypus Bear. They both sing and play all the instruments. They record demos and put them online as EPs every now and then.</p>

    <p>Ed Tovell also used to play bass in a band called The Shenanigans, of which there is no electronic record. There is a VHS somewhere of him singing Oasis' <em>Supersonic</em> extremely out of tune, but it will probably never resurface.</p>
