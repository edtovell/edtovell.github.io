    <p>Ed Tovell keeps a blog called "I Review Literally Anything", which applies the stars-out-of-five critique format to all manner of things, both usual and un. It can be found at <a href="https://ireviewliterallyanything.wordpress.com/">ireviewliterallyanything.wordpress.com</a>.</p>
    <p>There is also a comic strip that Ed Tovell draws, but you can't get to it from here because it is NSFW and a bit dark. It has been printed in Cheesegrater magazine and is also the subject of an interactive fiction he wrote in <a href="http://twinery.org">Twine.</a> If for some reason you want to see more, you can ask Ed Tovell for the link.</p>

    <p>Ed Tovell is as surprised as you are that some of his Edinburgh Fringe reviews appeared in the August 2009 edition of Scotsgay Magazine. You can try and find them in <a href="http://www.scotsgay.co.uk/pdf/sg93.pdf">here</a>.</p>
